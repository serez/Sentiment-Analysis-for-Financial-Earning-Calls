Our research was conducted utilizing sentiment analysis to help quantify public earnings
calls done by public companies. Outlined in this report presents our findings and research results
by using the sentimental value for each earnings call. Our objective was to create a model that
can detect positive or negative connotations and subsequently determine the effects of the share
price (pre and post-earnings call). We utilized various natural language processing (NLP)
techniques such as bag-of-words, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
(BERT), and Financial BERT (FinBERT). The primary goal is to understand if a correlation
between the share price and sentiment during the call has any effect on the post-share price,
based on our chosen model.
